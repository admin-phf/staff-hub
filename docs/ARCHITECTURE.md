# PHF Staff Hub structure

## Principle
The Staff Hub is the menu. Each tool is an independent mini-application.

```
staff-hub/
├── index.html                     # Staff Hub home only
├── assets/                        # Shared hub-only assets
│   └── css/hub.css
├── tools/
│   ├── update-specials/           # Existing working project
│   │   └── index.html
│   └── reconcile-ch2/             # New project
│       ├── index.html
│       ├── css/app.css
│       └── js/

│           │   ├── pos-order.js
│           │   └── supplier-invoice.js
│           ├── core/reconcile.js
│           └── export/report.js
├── docs/
│   └── ARCHITECTURE.md
├── .gitignore
└── .nojekyll
```

## Change isolation
A change to Update Specials should normally touch only `tools/update-specials/`.
A change to CH2 Reconciliation should normally touch only `tools/reconcile-ch2/`.
Change the root `index.html` only when adding/removing a Staff Hub tile.

## Git workflow
- `main` is the live site.
- Create a short branch for each change, e.g. `update-specials/new-layout` or `reconcile-ch2/pdf-parser`.
- Test the branch before merging to `main`.
- Use small commits with clear messages.
- Tag stable releases (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`) so they are easy to restore.

## Data / security
Never commit invoices, POS exports, customer data, passwords, API keys or account information.
Browser-side processing is preferred for reconciliation documents so the input files never become site content.

## Build Master Databases
`tools/database-build/` is an independent browser-side database preparation tool.

Current implemented stages:
1. POS Database — browser port of `MASTER 2.0, Step 1 - Merging PosActive Files Integration & Brand Abbreviation` (POS Builder v5.0.0).
2. Oborne / CH2 — browser port of `MASTER 2.0, Step 2 - CH2 Pricelist Formatter + SOH + Weight & Dimensions Loader` (CH2 Builder v1.0.0).

3. Unique / UHP — browser port of `MASTER, Step 2.5 - UHP Pricelist Formatter, Brand Mapping & Index Generation` (Unique Builder v1.0.0).

All implemented stages keep source business files local to the browser and generate the two Excel workbooks defined by their supplied Python sources. CH2 optional inputs include Brand Abbreviation and Weight & Dimensions. Unique / UHP optionally accepts Brand Abbreviation.


## Database Builder v8.0.0 — Combined Master

- Stage 4: `tools/database-build/master.html`
- Required inputs are the full working outputs from POS, Oborne / CH2 and Unique / UHP.
- Reduced `*_pos_db` outputs are rejected.
- Generates the fixed 98-column selected master used by MASTER Step 3.
- Matching priority: barcode, then Brand + SUB ID, then code with brand validation.
- Primary workbook uses a dark navy/yellow dynamic summary row, pale blue header row, alternating body rows and blue/red price-change emphasis.
- Current v1.0.0 parity validation covers the three required full working files without additional discount / AV inputs.


## Database Builder v9.0.0 (2026-10-05 14:57 AEDT)
- Unified one-screen workflow at `tools/database-build/index.html`.
- Raw source files are uploaded once and retained in browser memory for all stages.
- Generated full POS, CH2 and UHP models feed Combined Master directly without download/re-upload.
- Output filenames follow the original Python scripts with Melbourne date-based names.
- Unique/UHP downloads use persistent browser download links rather than hidden programmatic button downloads.
